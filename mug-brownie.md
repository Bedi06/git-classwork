I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!
I first tried this recipe when visiting my grandmother in New  York ,it's was wiinter holidays and everything was sparkly and festive .That made it one of the best holidays of my life .
I will always be greateful to my grandmother for teaching me this recipe.
